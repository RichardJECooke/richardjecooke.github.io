		<h2 class="link">Graphic score generator (song visualiser)</h2>

	(This app seems to be working only in Firefox in 2022, not in Chromium browsers, due to a
	<a href="https://github.com/meyda/meyda/issues/286"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deprecation of the older web audio tools</a>.)

		<h2 class="link">Esperanto letero konvertilo (Esperanto letter converter)</h2>
	</a>
	This app will allow you to convert letters like ‘Cx’ to the Esperanto version with a circumflex, ‘Ĉ’.
	It's useful for typing quickly on a Latin (English) keyboard, copying the text to the app to convert
	it to proper Esperanto letters, and pasting back into your document.
