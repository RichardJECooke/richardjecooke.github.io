You'd think WordPress would take your HTML as given when you paste it into the text editor (not visual editor) of a page or post. But no, when you view your page WordPress has decided to add lots of `<br>` and `<p>` elements wherever it feel like.

Prevent this by installing this tiny plugin to disable automatic layout breaking: [https://wordpress.org/plugins/dont-muck-my-markup/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/dont-muck-my-markup/)

> UPDATE 2018: Rather write your posts in Markdown using Wordpress built in support for Markdown.
