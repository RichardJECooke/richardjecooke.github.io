Rise
----

A calm string quartet with a subdued melody, suitable for a film soundtrack.  
  
It shows counterpoint, modulation, interesting chords, use of register, and development of a simple theme while maintaining interest. It also uses a sneaky tempo change to create a lively middle section and more majestic conclusion.  
  
Inspired by Barber's adagio for strings and Glass's Mishima, mvt. 6.

K134
----

The first string quartet I wrote. A few bold themes that get layered.  
Pretty & slightly tragic.  
  
This one shows my ability to write a more lyrical melody.

Just friends (Klenner & Lewis)
------------------------------

A brass band arrangement of the jazz standard (i.e. chords and melody were given).  
  
This shows orchestration, solos & accompaniment, jazz harmony, reharmonisation, and the use of swing and latin rhythms.
