This short tutorial shows you how to edit photos or videos into a single video with transitions and effects using only Reaper's native functionality. It's a great way to use a few photos to make a music video or speak over a desktop recording to make a how-to video.  
  

Step 1 - Add two tracks and some photos (the top track (layer) of video always shows over the bottom one)

Step 2 - Add the video plugin, set the preset, and add an opacity automation envelope to create a crossfade

Step 3 (optional) - Add more preset effects, like stage lighting, and zoom & pan to create a Ken Burns effect
