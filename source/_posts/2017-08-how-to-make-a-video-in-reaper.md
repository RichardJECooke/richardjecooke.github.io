This short tutorial shows you how to edit photos or videos into a single video with transitions and effects using only Reaper's native functionality. It's a great way to use a few photos to make a music video or speak over a desktop recording to make a how-to video.

## 1) Add two tracks and some photos (the top track (layer) of video always shows over the bottom one)

## 2) Add the video plugin, set the preset, and add an opacity automation envelope to create a crossfade

## 3) Add more preset effects, like stage lighting, and zoom & pan to create a Ken Burns effect (_optional_)

## 4) Render the video

Use the webm format as the others are huge. 25 fps. 1920x1080. A couple of minutes shouldn't be more than 100Mb.
