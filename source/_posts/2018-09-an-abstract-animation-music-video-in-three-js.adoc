== Inspiration

=== 2D animation
My first inspiration was early abstract animation music videos. The best example of this is Norman McLaren's _Dots_ <<101>>, shown below:

video::E3-vsKwQ0Cg[youtube, width=700, height=400, theme=dark]

This video has important features:

* it is 2D (making it much simpler to create than a 3D animation where physics and camera positioning matter)
* shapes move, scale, and rotate (this is simple to do on computer)
* shapes morph from one shape to another (this may the same amount of work by hand as scale and rotating, but on a computer it requires much more work to draw two different shapes and tween all the points in between them)
* the animation is synchronised to the beat of the music (this is more work than having a freely moving animation because you have to coordinate visuals and music precisely to the millisecond).

=== 3D animation

I then looked for 3D abstract animation and found SLICED by dxmiq <<102>>:

video::69668299[vimeo, width=700, height=400, theme=dark]

This looks pretty and impressive but I imagine is quite simple to make. I would simply draw a long line of shapes and then automate the camera to move down the line, with a clipping plane "slicing" the shapes as the camera passes along them.

=== Programmatic animation
I had made an application for TEDx Cape Town a few years ago that pulled tweets from Twitter that were tagged with the conference hashtag and displayed them on a giant projector on the wall.
I thought about something similar for a music video and searched to see if anything like this had been done before. It has, by Brightly for their song _Preflight nerves_ <<103>>:

video::hMaeY0aP1xQ[youtube, width=700, height=400, theme=dark]

The video above is static, but the one on their http://tweetflight.wearebrightly.com[website] pulls fresh tweets to match the song lyrics in realtime each time you play it.

I then discovered the most impressive video yet. _Dennis_ is a procedurally generated 3D animated, gesture interactive, beat synchronised music video <<104>>:

The animation was programmed in https://threejs.org/[three.js].
It is very smooth and quick to render as it uses modern web browsers' support for the graphics processing unit (GPU) by using WebGL.
Finally, the animation was synchronised to the beat of the song by using WebAudio's native analysis capability.


This video shows the power you have when you don't have to animate every shape manually, but can write code to create and manipulate the shapes and camera for you.
