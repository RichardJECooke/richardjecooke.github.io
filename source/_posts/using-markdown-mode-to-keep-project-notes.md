I like keeping a small notes file in a Visual Studio solution explaining how to compile it, any overall code comments, journal of decisions made, etc. Stuff that you want do quickly without having a whole separate word processing document or technical specification for.

But plain old notes.txt is hard to read without any formatting.  I recommend [Markdown Mode](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/0855e23e-4c4c-4c82-8b39-24ab5c5a7f79), a VS extension.  It allows you to quickly edit notes in text, and easily read them formatted helpfully as HTML.  It even allows you to link to images to display.
