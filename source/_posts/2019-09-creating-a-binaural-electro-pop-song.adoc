== Introduction
This article is a conceptual planning document for a binaural song - a piece
of music where the instruments sound as if they are positioned in 3D space and
move through it, around the head of the listener.

This was done as an assignment for the course Music Technology 3A at UCT.

== The final product
Below is the song I made:

video::F_PfTrxxxzo[youtube, width=700, height=400, theme=dark]

The melody and lyrics were written by Michelle Pretorius and the singer was Clare Dublin.

== Inspiration

=== Course assignment

For our Music Technology 3A project we were asked to create an original piece of music
that was mixed primarily using spatial audio. I preferred to choose a stereo mix over surround-sound
because multi-speaker pieces would not be heard by anyone except the few people that came to our
class concert. A stereo mix however can by published to the Internet and easily heard
by anyone with a pair of speakers or headphones.

Specifically I wanted to create a binaural mix - one where the sounds seem to come from specific
points in space around the head.

=== Binaural (3D) sounds

Twelve years ago in 2007 I heard one of the most popular binaural microphone demonstrations -
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUDTlvagjJA[_The virtual barbershop_] <<ref_barbershop>> :

video::IUDTlvagjJA[youtube, width=700, height=400, theme=dark]

This video was recorded with a binaural microphone but there are now free VST plugins
that reproduce the HRTFs (head-related transfer functions) that change the frequencies and panning
of sounds depending on where in space they are intended to come from.<<ref_hrtf>> In other words
we can now take any mono sound and make it sound in headphones like it is positioned anywhere in space
that we choose. If you listen to the barbershop video above without headphones you'll hear that this
technique degrades elegantly onto stereo speakers - you lose the binaural effect but the mix still
sounds good.

I found two free VSTs that look suitable:

- http://anaglyph.dalembert.upmc.fr[_Anaglyph_]
- https://en-us.sennheiser.com/ambeo-orbit[_AMBEO Orbit_]

AMBEO Orbit is made by Sennheiser and looks better designed but doesn't support distance from the head,
only direction. Anaglyph supports both parameters and additionally allows from micro-oscillations -
continuous small changes in position that improve the realistic effect of a sound being positioned in space.

=== Binaural music and resources

Mixing a song in 3D as opposed to in stereo seems to be almost non-existent, at least in chart-toppers.
This is suprising as one can imagine how much more immersive and exciting music would be if it sounded like it was all around you.
I can think of a few reasons for binaural mixing not being done:

- Most people listen to music on mono radios or car stereo systems. Thus it is more economical to mix for these systems to appeal to the most listeners and make the most profit.
- Producers aren't aware of binaural possibilities.
- Producers don't think the effect enhances the music enough to do it.
- Maintaining the realism reduces creative possibilities. I.e. for a sound to maintain the illusion of 3D you can do far less with EQ, reverb, and other effects.

I don't think the first point is relevant binaural music doesn't sound worse on speakers than normal stereo mixes.
The last point is however a possiblity I had to consider carefully when writing the song. Certain necessities arise:

- All sounds have to be reduced to mono before positioned in space.
- EQing must be done before positioning - as the positioning itself relies heavily on EQ.
- Reverb and delay must be used sparingly, carefully, and with enough initial delay time not to interfere with the 3D effect.

Finally, as Catherine Robinson from the BBC binaural department notes, you should use as few sounds as possible so the mix
does not become cluttered and the ear becomes too overwhelmed to maintain the 3D illusion.<<ref_bbcvid>>

Searching Google and YouTube in 2019 for binaural music finds nothing - only references to binaural beats and immersive audio (not music).
In fact the whole BBC binaural sound department has no reference to music at all.<<ref_bbc>>
Nor does the Immersive Audio podcast.<<ref_iapod>>

The only music I managed to find


my old water song

1) Concept plan: which includes creative ideas and reference mixes /
audio files as inspiration. The majority of material should be your own, i.e.
recorded, synthesized, sampled and processed or created by you. You
may use up to 10% of found creative commons audio material, but you
must reference their copyright in the essay component.

== Composition plan

Michy & Clare
2) Mixing Aesthetics: Write a mixing strategy for your project and what
your intentions are aesthetically.


4) Practical Mix Plan: Draw up a plan considering how best to tackle your
mix and which processes you would follow while carefully considering and
discussing your chosen material. This section may include diagrams /
timelines / audio files etc.

== Dangers

3) Technical Skills Analysis: Discuss the technical skills you will need to
complete this assignment. Consider your current technical skill level in
terms
of critical listening, plug-in skills and mix technique and identify any
shortcomings that you need to work on in order to realize this assignment.
5) Potential Problems: Identify possible problems, potential solutions and
trouble-shooting strategies, so you do not fall into easily avoidable
potholes along the way.

== Retrospective
6) Critical Reflection: Once your mix is complete, rest your ears for a few
days, and then listen critically. Review your mix as objectively as possible.
State what worked well and not so well, and how you could improve in a
future mixing project.

=== 2D animation

==== Dots

My first inspiration was early abstract animation music videos. The best example of this is Norman McLaren's https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3-vsKwQ0Cg[_Dots_] <<ref_dots>>, shown below:

video::E3-vsKwQ0Cg[youtube, width=700, height=400, theme=dark]

* it is 2D (making it much simpler to create than a 3D animation where physics and camera positioning matter)
* shapes move, scale, and rotate (this is simple to do on computer)

==== Preflight nerves
video::hMaeY0aP1xQ[youtube, width=700, height=400, theme=dark]

==== Dennis

I then discovered the most impressive video yet. http://www.dennis.video[_Dennis_] is a procedurally generated 3D animated, gesture interactive, beat synchronised music video <<ref_dennis>>:

<iframe src='http://www.dennis.video' width='700px' height='400px'></iframe>
+++

The animation was programmed in https://threejs.org/[three.js].

==== Synfig Studio

For 2D vector animation the best tool I could find was Synfig Studio <<ref_synfig>>.

image::https://i1.wp.com/www.synfig.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/screenshot-07.png[Synfig Studio, 700, 400]

Synfig allows you to draw complex vector shapes directly into the application or import external images.
Each object's properties (e.g. size, rotation, outline, color, etc.) can be independently altered at any point (keyframe) in an animation of any length.
Synfig will then automically fill in (tween) the animation between each keyframe.
It also supports advanced functions like masking layers, blend modes, duplication and time manipuation, and skeleton animation.

Synfig would be the perfect tool to make something simple like _Dots_ and I was able to work through all the tutorials in a day.

==== two.js

For 2D programmatic animation the best framework I found was https://two.js.org/examples/[two.js] <<ref_twojs>>.

+++
<iframe src='https://two.js.org/examples' width='700px' height='600px'></iframe>
+++

two.js would be best for creating a video like _Dots_ but with much more complexity and movement, or for creating something with text, like _Preflight nerves_.


=== 3D animation

==== Blender & Grease Pencil

https://www.blender.org[Blender] is the undisputed champion of free 3D modelling and animation software.
It has been around for years and its features rival industry standards like _Maya_.

Recently Blender has also added powerful capabilities for beautiful 2D illustrated animations through its https://vimeo.com/155635261[_grease pencil_] tool (which used to be a simple way for animators to annotate their work quickly for later use) <<ref_greasepencil>>.

=== Programmatic 3D animation

==== three.js

The best framework I could find for 3D programmatic animation was https://threejs.org[three.js] <<ref_threejs>>.

I decided to write a little story about an acoustic bass meeting a modern synthesiser and having a conversation/song.
