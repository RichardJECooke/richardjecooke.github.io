== Introduction
This article is a conceptual planning document for a binaural song - a piece
of music where the instruments sound as if they are positioned in 3D space and
move through it, around the head of the listener.

This was done as an assignment for the course Music Technology 3A at UCT.

== Inspiration

=== Course assignment

For our Music Technology 3A project we were asked to create an original piece of music
that was mixed primarily using spatial audio. I preferred to choose a stereo mix over surround-sound
because multi-speaker pieces would not be heard by anyone except the few people that came to our
class concert. A stereo mix however can by published to the Internet and easily heard
by anyone with a pair of speakers or headphones.

Specifically I wanted to create a binaural mix - one where the sounds seem to come from specific
points in space around the head.

=== Binaural (3D) sounds

Twelve years ago in 2007 I heard one of the most popular and inspiring binaural microphone demonstrations -
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUDTlvagjJA[_The virtual barbershop_] <<ref_barbershop>> :

video::IUDTlvagjJA[youtube, width=700, height=400, theme=dark]

This video was recorded with a binaural microphone but there are now free VST plugins
that reproduce the HRTFs (head-related transfer functions) that change the frequencies and panning
of sounds depending on where in space they are intended to come from.<<ref_hrtf>> In other words
we can now take any mono sound and make it sound in headphones like it is positioned anywhere in space
that we choose. If you listen to the barbershop video above without headphones you'll hear that this
technique degrades elegantly onto stereo speakers - you lose the binaural effect but the mix still
sounds good.

I found two free VSTs that looked suitable:

- http://anaglyph.dalembert.upmc.fr[_Anaglyph_]
- https://en-us.sennheiser.com/ambeo-orbit[_AMBEO Orbit_]

AMBEO Orbit is made by Sennheiser and looks more professionaly made but doesn't support distance from the head,
only direction. Anaglyph supports both parameters and additionally allows from micro-oscillations -
continuous small changes in position that improve the realistic effect of a sound being positioned in space.
But Anaglyph tends to crash when using automation.

=== Binaural music and resources

Mixing a song in 3D as opposed to in stereo seems to be almost non-existent, at least in chart-toppers.
This is suprising as one can imagine how much more immersive and exciting music would be if it sounded like it was moving all around you.
I can think of a few reasons for binaural mixing not being done:

- Most people listen to music on mono radios or car stereo systems. Thus it is more economical to mix for these systems to appeal to the most listeners and make the most profit.
- Producers aren't aware of binaural possibilities.
- Producers don't think the effect enhances the music enough to do it.
- Maintaining the realism reduces creative possibilities. I.e. for a sound to maintain the illusion of 3D you can do far less with EQ, reverb, and other effects.

I don't think the first point is relevant as binaural music doesn't sound worse on speakers than normal stereo mixes.
The last point is however a possiblity I had to consider carefully when writing the song. Certain necessities arise:

- All sounds have to be reduced to mono before positioned in space.
- EQing must be done before positioning - as the positioning itself relies heavily on EQ.
- Reverb and delay must be used sparingly, carefully, and with enough initial delay time not to interfere with the 3D effect.

Finally, as Catherine Robinson from the BBC binaural department notes, you should use as few sounds as possible so the mix
does not become cluttered and the ear becomes too overwhelmed to maintain the 3D illusion.<<ref_bbcvid>>

Searching Google and YouTube in 2019 for binaural music finds nothing - only references to binaural beats and immersive audio (not music).
In fact the whole BBC binaural sound department has no reference to music at all.<<ref_bbc>>
Nor does the _Immersive Audio podcast_.<<ref_iapod>>

The only music I managed to find was the playlist https://music.apple.com/in/playlist/introduction-to-binaural-tracks/pl.u-kv9lbRjC7qVXKRE?app=music[_here_].<<ref_binplay>>
These songs are all beautifully mixed and sound great through headphones or speakers.
But I don't feel much opportunity was taken to use spatial illusions fully.
The sounds are all from a static position in space and never move in any direction.
I aimed to make better use of movement, position, distance, and reverberation in my song.

=== Initial idea

Last year I created a piece of music focussing on the Kreepy Krauly and the sound of water in general.<<ref_kreepy>>

video::X-prfGOo_wA[youtube, width=700, height=400, theme=dark]

I thought water would be a rich source of ideas for a new binaural piece.
I have also wanted to write a pop song for a while.
Thus I asked a classmate, Michelle Pretorius, to write a melody and lyrics for a water themed song.
I took her ideas and notated them neatly in Musescore to arrange a verse, prechorus, chorus, and bridge, shown below:

image::score.png[Sheet music]

Following this I downloaded various no-attribution-required water sounds and sea sounds from freesound.org<<ref_freesound>> and recorded the vocals with another classmate, Clare Dublin.
I aimed to merge the water sounds and vocals with an atmospheric electro-pop composition and then mix it binaurally.

Other than the vocals and water samples I wanted to use only virtual instruments as I much prefer the ease of working with MIDI to the immutability of recorded sound.
My DAW of choice for this project was FL Studio<<ref_fls>>, as I enjoy its pattern based approach to composition, its workflow and native plugins being optimised for electronic music, and single-window optimised screen layout with function key shortcuts to all major sections: patterns, playlist, MIDI, mixer, and instruments.

=== Reference songs

The lyrics of the song use the following ideas:

- crystal
- ocean
- sadness
- drowning / sinking
- flying
- striving

Specifically, I needed to find ideas for the:

- bass sound
- harmony sound
- textural ideas
- and other things I hadn't thought of.

=== Reference songs
After looking through my music that spans a couple of decades I found the following songs that inspired techniques to try:

- Alan Walker - Faded - Modern synthesizer soudns
- Alex & Sierra - Scarecrow - Subtle clap mixed over kick in chorus, strummed acoustic guitar on verses
- Amphibia - Grey Area - Clicks with delay
- All Saints - Pure Shores - Delay synths & tambourines & bass
- Austra - Lose it - bells, vibrato on the bridge and bass
- Avicii - Broken arrows - raising the cut off throughout a verse, guitar bass, dual synths (pluck and supersaw), put a low pass on the prechorus and remove on the chorus
- Avicii - Two similar rhythm guitars with slight differences panned left and right, glissando lead synth
- Bart & Baker - Thrift Shop (remix of Macklemore) - glitch loops on the bridge
- Chris Brayman - The Dive (Ecoquest) - open the song with a gull's cry
- Coldplay - every song - change the harmony to a four chord progression (with interesting inversions) and sus4 dominants, choir-like pads
- Coldplay - Viva la vida - bells on off beats, reverse bells, long strings, short punchy strings on off beats
- Coldplay - Fix you - organ
- deadmau5 - Raise your weapon - staccato supersaw chords on 8th notes, mixture of piano and guitar bass
- DJ Sammy - Heaven - long strings, high piano
- Donna Lewis - I love you - high bass on 16th notes, long thick piano chords on bridge
- Donna Lewis - Harvest moon - vibrato rhodes piano
- Ellie Golding - Burn - tape stop on the end of vocal phrases
- Jordan Sparks - Tattoo - continuous ghost snares
- Katy Perry - I'm still breathing - snare rolls
- Moby - Porcelain - reversed strings, slow high piano melody over faster lower song
- Sugababes - Good to be gone - a simple bass ostinato on the verse
- Taylor Swift - Wildest dreams - low passed kick drum, reverb on end of all words, wordless vocals in musical interlude

== Composition plan

Given the reference songs above, below is a coarse grained plan of the whole composition:

=== Introduction
- kick, shaker, last bar snare fill
- bass ostinato: using the pluck bass from this video, but made in Sytrus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6i55lXAMh0
- ambient ocean sound at very low volume
- vinyl plugin for fuzz and scratches

=== Verse 1
- add snare to drums
- add sub bass
- supersaw plucked with delay left vs another synth right, with slightly different rhythms
- high tinkle bell (crystal)
- raise cutoff on both synths through the verse
- reverb on vocal word ends
- foley: dolphin

=== Prechorus 1
- low pass everything
- remove subbass
- remove kick
- add clicks
- add hats
- ocean sound buildup to the chorus

=== Chorus 1
- kick louder
- clap on kick
- tambourine on off beat opposite side to hat

=== Verse 2
- rain
- long strings
- continuous ghost snares and rolls
- strummed acoustic guitar?
- foley: seagull, whale

=== Prechorus 2
- tape stop on word ends

=== Chorus 2
- Add one more element - possibly water sounds to chorus 1

=== Interlude
- kick drum sidechain
- reversed strings
- slow piano melody over faster beat
- some vocal ohhahhs

=== Bridge
- bass is piano and guitar, long notes
- vibrato rhodes piano
- vibrato on vocals
- glitch

=== Chorus 3
- same as chorus 2

=== Coda
No idea yet. I planned to be inspired from something during the productiion process.

== Mixing strategy
To get mixing ideas I read Rumsey's book on spatial audio <<ref_rumsey>> and found that only two points were worthwhile to this process:

- binaural audio is not effective unless the listener can turn their head to eliminate any confusion in pinpointing the elevation of a source,
and whether it is front or rear. This can be fixed by moving the virtual sound source, rather than keeping it static.
- pop music is artificial and thus harder to make 3D than an orchestra or natural soundscape.

I also watched a lot of mixing and sound production videos from this FL Studio orientated music production and mixing https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIcCXe3iWo6lq-iWKV40Oug/videos[YouTube channel].<<ref_inthemix>>

I combined this with my previous years' mixing experience, and inspiration gained by listening to all the binaural tracks mentioned previously, to create a mixing strategy. The items in this strategy were to be applied in conjunction with the composition plan listed previously.

This was the plan:

- Give each instrument/sound in the song its own position in 3D space and move it slightly but continuously throughout to mimic reality.
- The spatial change between verse and chorus should be large to create contrast and interest.
- Reverb should be used sparingly and have a long predelay so as not to interfere with the binaural effect.
- Some sounds, mostly the large surf and ocean sounds, should not be binaural and should have a lot of reverb, to create contrast with the more precise and clean instrument sounds.

Other than these 3D considerations my mix plan was similar to any other pop song plan, including ideas such as:

- Using exciters/saturators on all instruments
- Putting the bass and vocals in the center
- Using EQ to eliminate any masking and separate instruments clearly
- Using automated low pass EQ to create change between verse and chorus, and increasing excitement over time

== Dangers

This section discusses risks to creating the intended song from the plan in this document.

=== Technical skills

The biggest skill deficit I had was the music composition itself.
I anticipated having trouble trying to create music that sounded as good as my reference tracks and suited the lyrics.
Most importantly, I had no experience at all in creating entirely synthesizer music, and little in synthesizer sound design.

As a contingency if I failed at synthesizer music when composing I could always retreat to acoustic virtual instruments, where I have a little more experience.

On the mixing side I didn't see any potential skill deficits.
I have made many mixes in the past and was entirely at ease with DAWs, VSTs, and automation of effects.
Furthermore after experimenting with the binaural VST I found it simple to use.

=== Potential problems

The biggest problem, other than composition, that I expected was that the binaural effect would not be as appealing as expected, or it would be difficult to achieve without creating an overly simple mix.
The first problem cannot be overcome and is the research part of this original composition.
The second problem could be dealt with by using fewer sounds.
